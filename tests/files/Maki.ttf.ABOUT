notes: The font file has been generated by me from the SVG icons of the Maki project by
    Mapbox, LLC.

    Please note that the mapping of the glyphs to their Unicode code points does not
    have any further meaning. I just used FontForge to import the SVG files in the
    alphabetical order as presented by the file chooser.
